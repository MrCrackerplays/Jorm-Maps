# Jorm Maps
A project to display the DnD westmarches world of Jorm using the [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) library.

Though made specifically for the world of Jorm, it can easily be reused for any other world by editing the locations.json file. Likewise to add/edit existing locations just edit the locations.json file. (Fork and pull request or ask to become a contributor to directly push changes)

# Locations.json
The [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) file which is used to load all marker and image location data.
