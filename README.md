# Jorm Maps
A project to display the DnD westmarches world of Jorm using the [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) library.

Though made specifically for the world of Jorm, it can easily be reused for any other world by editing the locations.json file. Likewise to add/edit existing locations just edit the locations.json file. (Fork and pull request or ask to become a contributor to directly push changes)

# Sharing locations
Locations specified with markers in the [Locations.json](#locationsjson) file can be shared by specifying both a `plane=` and a `location=` url parameter. Alternatively any location can be shared by specifying its latitude and longitude with both the `lat=` and `lng=` url parameters. Additionally there `zoom=` url parameter can be specified to share a location at a specific zoom level (LeafletJS zoom levels, meaning 0 is zoomed out and 20 is zoomed in).

Example
```
http://localhost:8000/?plane=Jorm&location=Dod%27Estrin
http://localhost:8000/?plane=Jorm&location=Dod%27Estrin&zoom=5
http://localhost:8000/?lat=2815360.8285000003&lng=3152704.8960000006
http://localhost:8000/?lat=2815360.8285000003&lng=3152704.8960000006&zoom=5
```

# Running locally
When trying to open the index.html after cloning you'll notice that it won't load correctly, this is due to the fact that you can't use a `fetch()`, which is used to load locations.json, on local files (Cross-Origin Request Blocked). So in order to test the page and anything on it you'll have to run an http server and open that in your browser instead, for example with python you can run `py -m http.server` in your working directory and it'll be available on http://localhost:8000 by default.

# Locations.json
The [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) file which is used to load all marker and image data.

## Structure
The base of Locations.json is made of key-value pairs for [Planes](#plane).
```JSON
{
	"Jorm": {...},
	"Shadowfell": {...},
	...
}
```

### Plane
A Plane is made of key-value pairs for [Places](#place).
```JSON
"Plane": {
	"Dod'Estrin": {...},
	"Wizard Tower": {...},
	...
}
```

### Place
A Place has 3 optional objects: [`image`](#image), [`images`](#images), [`marker`](#marker). Where `images` will be ignored if an `image` object has also been supplied.
```JSON
"Place 1": {
	"images": {...},
	"marker": {...}
},
"Place 2": {
	"image": {...}
}
```

### Images
An Images object is made of key-value pairs for [Image objects](#image) where the key is the floor at which the image is located.
```JSON
"images": {
	"-5": {...},
	"0": {...},
	"3": {...},
	...
}
```

### Image
An Image has a required [`meta`](#image-meta) object containing meta data about where the image is located and optionally options that are passed to the leaflet constructor for the image. By default if not set an image will have the option `pane` set to "tilePane" which adds all generated html elements to the same container div.
```JSON
"image": {
	"meta": {...},
	"opacity": 1,
	...
}
```

#### Image Meta
Image metadata has 3 required objects: [`position`](#image-position), [`layers`](#layers), `file`. Where `file` is a string which is the link to the image to be shown, if the image is local then it'll be found relative to the images folder.
```JSON
"meta": {
	"position": {...},
	"file": "DodEstrin.jpg",
	"layers": {...}
}
```

#### Image Position
An image position has an optional `rotation` which is how many degrees the image will be rotated and a required boundaries representation which can be either `bounds`, which is a 2 long array of [latlng](#latlng)'s which define the top-left latlng and bottom-right latlng of the boundaries, or a combination of a `width` [length](#length), a `height` [length](#length), and either a `center` [location](#location) or `topleft` latlng (if both are defined the `center` will take precedent).
```JSON
"position": {
	"bounds": [[33, 33], [44, 44]]
}
//
"position": {
	"rotation": 33,
	"width": {...},
	"height": {...},
	"center": {...}
}
//
"position": {
	"width": {...},
	"height": {...},
	"topleft": {...}
}
```

### Marker
A Marker has a required [`meta`](#marker-meta) object containing meta data about where the marker is located and optionally options that are passed to the leaflet constructor for the marker.
```JSON
"marker": {
	"meta": {...},
	"attribution": "A brain",
	...
}
```

#### Marker Meta
Marker metadata has an optional object [`click`](#click) and 2 required objects: [`location`](#location), [`layers`](#layers).
```JSON
"meta": {
	"location": {...},
	"click": {...},
	"layers": {...}
}
```

#### Click
A Click object has an optional `jump_zoom` number which specifies what at zoomlevel will be zoomed to when the marker is clicked. (Currently that's the only click option but it's an object for future possible additional options)
```JSON
"click": {
	"jump_zoom": 13
}
```

### Layers
Layers has 2 required numbers `min`, `max` which define the range from what layer until what layer (inclusive) the marker/image is visible.
```JSON
"layers": {
	"min": 13,
	"max": 19
}
```

### Location
A Location is an object that resolves to a latlng which can be using one of 3 ways: 1. [`latlng`](#latlng), 2. [`origin`](#origin) and [`offset`](#offset), 3. [`origin`](#origin), `distance` [length](#length), and [`direction`](#direction). They have precedence in that order and are all required for their respective ways.
```JSON
//1
"location": {
	"latlng": [200, 30]
}
//2
"location": {
	"origin": {...},
	"offset": {...}
}
//3
"location": {
	"origin": {...},
	"direction": {...},
	"distance": {...}
}
```

### Latlng
A Latlng is a number array of 2 numbers representing a Latitude and Longitude, in that order.
```JSON
"latlng": [42, 420]
```

### Length
A Length is a representation of a distance, either by specifying the length itself, via `meter`, `feet`, `tiles`, `kilometers`, and `mile`, or by specifying a [`duration`](#duration). (Taking precedence in that order)
```JSON
"length": {
	"meter": 10
}
//...
"length": {
	"duration": {...}
}
```

#### Duration
A Duration is a distance as specified by the travel duration in a number `days`, number `hours`, or special `hour_timestamp`. Assuming a travel speed of 3 mile/hour or 24 miles per day (As per the Travel Pace table in the 5e PHB).
```JSON
//10 and a half days of travel
"duration": {
	"days": 10.5
}
//4 and a half hours of travel
"duration": {
	"hours": 4.5
}
//1 hour and 20 minutes of travel
"duration": {
	"hour_timestamp": "1:20"
}
```

### Origin
An Origin is a relative point of reference which resolves to a [latlng](#latlng) using either `latlng` or a `location` which is the name of a [Place](#place) (specifically the place's marker will be used for getting its location, so if it doesn't have a marker it cannot be used as an origin) with optionally a [Plane](#plane)'s name to specify what plane that place is on if it's not on the same Plane the currently being assigned to location is.
```JSON
"origin": {
	"latlng": [60, 90]
}
//
"origin": {
	"location": "Dod'Estrin",
	"plane": "Jorm"
}
```

### Offset
An Offset has a `lat` [Length](#length) and a `lng` [Length](#length) which specify how far offset from the origin the latitude and longitude will be.
```JSON
"offset": {
	"lat": {...},
	"lng": {...}
}
```

### Direction
A Direction has an angle in `degrees`, `radians`, or a `compass` string. (Presedence in that order).
```JSON
"direction": {
	"degrees": 50.41
}
//
"direction": {
	"radians": 2.1
}
//
"direction": {
	"compass": "SSW"
}
```
